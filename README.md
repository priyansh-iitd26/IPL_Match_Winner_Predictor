**Project Overview**

This project predicts the winner of an Indian Premier League (IPL) match based on historical data and current match conditions. By analyzing past IPL matches and utilizing classification machine learning algorithms, this project provides insights and predictions to cricket enthusiasts and analysts.

The project implements a user-friendly interface, enabling users to input match conditions like teams, venue, toss decision, and more to predict the likely winner.

**Features**

- Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IPL match data to understand patterns and trends.

- Machine Learning Models: Implements classification algorithms to predict match outcomes.

- Custom Predictions: Allows users to input match details for tailored predictions.

- Visualizations: Provides graphical representations of key insights like win probabilities, team performance, and venue impact.

- Interactive Interface: A web-based interface for easy user interaction and predictions. The model is deployed on Streamlit as a web-service.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [IPL Complete Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020), which contains detailed records of IPL matches from 2008 to 2020, including team statistics, player performances, and match outcomes.
